# Codewars JS

A repo to collect JS Codewars challenges with TDD solutions.

These are generally one function solutions to small chalenges set by Codewars. I user them to keep my JavaScript skills sharp and to practice TDD.

## How to use
```bash
1. Clone the repo
2. npm install # install dependencies
3. npm jest # run tests
```

As the files are mostly single functions, there is little point in running them. However, if you want to do so, you can use node to run the files. For example:
```bash
1. node <file> # run file
```
